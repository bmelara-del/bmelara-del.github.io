            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Strong contrast between text and background; headings stand out clearly and readability is high</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Consistent fonts, button styles, spacing, and layout patterns across pages, which feels professional.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Elements align cleanly to a grid; content feels organized and easy to scan.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Related elements are grouped together, and spacing is consistent, making content easy to understand and navigate.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Too many bright colors and clashing elements can make it hard to focus on the main message.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Styles feel inconsistent (fonts, graphics, buttons), making the page look chaotic instead of cohesive.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Content feels scattered; many items don’t line up, so scanning the page is difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Unrelated content is packed together; important info can get lost because everything competes for attention.</li>
